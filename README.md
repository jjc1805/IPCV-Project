# IPCV-Project

Detection of defects in fruits and vegetables using k means segmentation and Otsu thresholding in Matlab. Both external and internal defects are detected. For external defects, the surface of the fruits in the image is processed. For internal defects, two approaches are followed. In the first one, the internal images of the fruits are processed for defects, whereas in the second one, the X-ray images of the images are taken and processed for defects.

# Implementation

1. The image_processing_project.m file contains all the code which is required to be run on MATLAB for the execution of this project.
2. The project report IPCV_Project_Report.pdf is also included.
3. All the other PNG files are the pictures of the fruits and vegetables being used in our project for the implementation.
